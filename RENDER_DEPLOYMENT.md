# Render Deployment Configuration

## CORS Issue Solution ✅

The CORS issue has been **SOLVED** by implementing a backend proxy server!

## How It Works

1. **Development**: Vite dev server with proxy
2. **Production**: Express.js server that serves the built files AND proxies SOAP requests

## New Architecture

```
Your Browser → Render (Express Server) → Azure SOAP Endpoint
```

The Express server acts as a middle layer that:
- Serves your React app
- Proxies SOAP requests to avoid CORS issues
- Adds proper headers and handles preflight requests

## Render Build Configuration

**Build Command:**
```bash
npm install && npm run build
```

**Start Command:**
```bash
npm start
```

**Environment:**
- **Node.js** (not Static Site)
- Auto-deploy from Git: ✅

## Files Added

1. **`server.js`**: Express proxy server
2. **Updated `package.json`**: Added Express dependencies and start script

## What Changed

- ✅ **No more CORS errors**: Express server handles all SOAP requests
- ✅ **Unified endpoint**: Always uses `/api/integrations/monthly.asmx`
- ✅ **Production ready**: Works identically in dev and production
- ✅ **Better logging**: Server logs all proxy requests for debugging

## Testing Locally

To test the production setup locally:

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

Then visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to Git** (all files including `server.js`)
2. **Create Render Web Service** (not Static Site)
3. **Set Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
4. **Set Start Command**: `npm start`
5. **Deploy** 🚀

## Health Check

Your deployed app will have a health check endpoint:
```
https://your-app.onrender.com/health
```
